# Basic-VHDL-codes
<br>
This repository contains a set of VHDL codes developed and tested using Xilinx Vivado software. The designs have been successfully implemented on the Artix-7 FPGA board, ensuring their functionality. Feel free to explore, and use these codes for your own projects.
<br>
Here are a few basic VHDL codes to start with, each accompanied by a reference testbench.

Included Codes:

1. ALU
2. FIFO
3. Shift Register
4. Mod-N Counter
